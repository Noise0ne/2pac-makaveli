		<p>AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Shakur as "the unlikely
			martyr of gangsta rap", with Shakur paying the ultimate price of a
			criminal lifestyle. Shakur was described as one of the top two American
			rappers in the 1990s, along with Snoop Dogg. The online rap magazine
			AllHipHop held a 2007 roundtable at which New York rappers Cormega,
			citing tour experience with New York rap duo Mobb Deep, imparted a broad
			assessment: "Biggie ran New York. 'Pac ran America." In 2010, writing
			Rolling Stone magazine's entry on Shakur at No. 86 among the "100 greatest
			artists", New York rapper 50 Cent appraised, "Every rapper who grew up in
			the Nineties owes something to Tupac. He didn't sound like anyone who came
			before him." Dotdash, formerly About.com, while ranking him fifth among
			the greatest rappers, nonetheless notes, "Tupac Shakur is the most
			influential hip-hop artist of all time. Even in death, 2Pac remains a
			transcendental rap figure." Yet to some, he was a "father figure" who,
			said rapper YG, "makes you want to be better—at every level."</p>
		<p>According to music journalist Chuck Philips, Shakur "had helped elevate
			rap from a crude street fad to a complex art form, setting the stage for
			the current global hip-hop phenomenon." Philips writes, "The slaying
			silenced one of modern music's most eloquent voices—a ghetto poet whose
			tales of urban alienation captivated young people of all races and
			backgrounds." Via numerous fans perceiving him, despite the questionable
			of his conduct, as a martyr, "the downsizing of martyrdom cheapens its
			use", Michael Eric Dyson concedes. But Dyson adds, "Some, or even most, of
			that criticism can be conceded without doing damage to Tupac's martyrdom
			in the eyes of those disappointed by more traditional martyrs." More
			simply, his writings, published after his death, inspired rapper YG to
			return to school and get his GED. In 2020, California Senator and
			Democratic vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris called Shakur the
			"best rapper alive", a mistake that she explained because "West Coast
			girls think 2Pac lives on".</p>
		<p>In 2006, Shakur's close friend and classmate Jada Pinkett Smith donated
			$1 million to their high school alma mater, the Baltimore School for the
			Arts, and named the new theater in his honor. In 2021, Pinkett Smith
			honored Shakur's 50th birthday by releasing a never before seen poem she
			had received from the late rapper.</p>
