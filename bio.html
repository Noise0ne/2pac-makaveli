		<h2>Tupac Amaru Shakur</h2>
		<p><b>Tupac Amaru Shakur</b> (/ˈtuːpɑːk ʃəˈkʊər/ TOO-pahk shə-KOOR; born
			Lesane Parish Crooks, June 16, 1971 – September 13, 1996), better known by
			his stage name <b>2Pac</b> and by his alias <b>Makaveli</b>, was a U.S.
			rapper, songwriter, and actor. He is widely considered to be one of the
			most influential rappers of all time. Much of Shakur's work has been noted
			for addressing contemporary social issues that plagued inner cities, and
			he has often been considered a symbol of activism against inequality.</p>

		<p>Shakur was born in Manhattan, a borough of New York City, but relocated
			to Baltimore, Maryland in 1984 and then the San Francisco Bay Area in
			1988. He moved to Los Angeles in 1993 to further pursue his music career.
			By the time he released his debut album 2Pacalypse Now in 1991, he had
			become a central figure in West Coast hip hop, introducing social issues
			to the genre at a time when gangsta rap was dominant in the mainstream.
			Shakur achieved further critical and commercial success with his follow-up
			albums Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z... (1993) and Me Against the World
			(1995).</p>
		<p>In 1995, Shakur served eight months in prison on sexual assault charges,
			but was released after agreeing to sign with Marion "Suge" Knight's label
			Death Row Records in exchange for Knight posting his bail. Following his
			release, Shakur became heavily involved in the growing East Coast–West
			Coast hip hop rivalry. His double-disc album All Eyez on Me (1996),
			abandoning introspective lyrics for volatile gangsta rap, was certified
			Diamond by the RIAA. On September 7, 1996, Shakur was shot four times by
			an unknown assailant in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada; he died
			six days later and the gunman was never captured. Shakur's friend-turned-
			rival, the Notorious B.I.G., was at first considered a suspect due to the
			pair's public feud, but was also murdered in another drive-by shooting six
			months later in Los Angeles, California. Five more albums have been
			released since Shakur's death, all of which have been certified Platinum
			in the United States.</p>
		<p>Shakur is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold
			over 75 million records worldwide. In 2002, he was inducted into the Hip-
			Hop Hall of Fame. In 2017, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of
			Fame in his first year of eligibility. Rolling Stone named Shakur in its
			list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Outside music, Shakur also
			found considerable success as an actor, with his starring roles as Bishop
			in Juice (1992), Lucky in Poetic Justice (1993) where he starred alongside
			Janet Jackson, Ezekiel in Gridlock'd (1997), and Jake in Gang Related
			(1997), all of which garnered praise from critics.</p>
